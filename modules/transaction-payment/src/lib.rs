///

///     m = maximum block weight
///     diff = (s - s')/m
///     v = 0.00001
///     t1 = (v * diff)
///     t2 = (v * diff)^2 / 2
/// then:
///     next_multiplier = prev_multiplier * (1 + t1 + t2)
///
/// Where `(s', v)` must be given as the `Get` implementation of the `T`
/// generic type. Moreover, `M` must provide the minimum allowed value for
/// the multiplier. Note that a runtime should ensure with tests that the
/// combination of this `M` and `V` is not such that the multiplier can drop
/// to zero and never recover.
///
/// note that `s'` is interpreted as a portion in the _normal transaction_
/// capacity of the block. For example, given `s' == 0.25` and
/// `AvailableBlockRatio = 0.75`, then the target fullness is _0.25 of the
/// normal capacity_ and _0.1875 of the entire block_.
///
/// This implementation implies the bound:
/// - `v ≤ p / k * (s − s')`
/// - or, solving for `p`: `p >= v * k * (s - s')`
///
/// where `p` is the amount of change over `k` blocks.
///
/// Hence:
/// - in a fully congested chain: `p >= v * k * (1 - s')`.
/// - in an empty chain: `p >= v * k * (-s')`.
///
/// For example, when all blocks are full and there are 28800 blocks per day
/// (default in `substrate-node`) and v == 0.00001, s' == 0.1875, we'd have:
///
/// p >= 0.00001 * 28800 * 0.8125
/// p >= 0.234
///
/// Meaning that fees can change by around ~23% per day, given extreme
/// congestion.
